      <h3>Essay Tone</h3>

      <p>
        When writing your essay, the tone must match the purpose of the essay. We will be writing
        formal and analytical paragraphs and essays. To ensure an appropriate tone in your essays,
        follow these recommendations:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Avoid first person (I, me, my we, our, us...)</li>
        <li>Avoid second person (you, your)</li>
        <li>Avoid contractions (can’t, won’t, it’s, shouldn’t…)</li>
        <li>Use an appropriate font, such as Times New Roman, Arial, or Calibri.</li>
        <li>
          Be direct in your essay, especially in the introduction. Questions and anecdotes are more
          appropriate for creative writing in English class than here.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Examples to avoid:</p>

      <div class="block">
        <p>
          I believe the school day should begin at 10:15am due to studies showing that adolescents
          have difficulty maintaining focus early in the day.
        </p>
        <p>
          Have you ever wondered about the best time to begin the school day? I will tell you in
          this essay.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="sectionBreak"></div>

      <a class="anchor" id="thesisStatements"></a>

      <h3>Thesis Statements</h3>

      <p>
        The thesis statement is a single sentence that states the main idea of your essay. The rest
        of your essay must support your thesis.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Make sure your thesis statement is at the end of your introduction and that it is clear,
          specific, and insightful.
        </li>
        <li>
          Formula for essay: A specific topic or subject + An assertion or claim about that topic +
          list of three reasons why.
        </li>
        <li>
          Formula for paragraph: A specific topic or subject is the topic sentence + an assertion or
          claim is the thesis. (The body will explain the supporting reasons or examples.)
        </li>
      </ul>

      <div class="block">
        <p>
          Thesis examples: <br /><br />
          In order to meet the needs of faculty, students, and parents, school days at Columbia
          Middle School should begin at 9am. <br /><br />
          School days at Columbia Middle School should begin at 9am to improve students' sleep
          habits, allow for before-school instruction, and better align with parents' schedules.

      <a class="anchor" id="summary"></a>

      <h3>Summary</h3>

      <p>The summary is your explanation of what happened. This is factual.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Do not rewrite the original piece</li>
        <li>Use your own words</li>
        <li>Refer to the central or main ideas of the piece</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Example:</p>

      <div class="block">
        <p>
          Utilizing MRI scans and diffusion tensor imaging, neuroscientist Gregory Berns determined
          the brain complexity of a thylacine, an extinct dog-like marsupial. Previously the animal
          was thought of as unintelligent, however, this study proves that thylacines had
          sophisticated frontal lobes and engaged in intricate hunting habits. This research led to
          the development of “Brain Ark”, a digital archive of animal brain scans. These images can
          be accessed by scientists around the world to further knowledge about the connection
          between the brain and environment. Through these and future investigations, new insight
          can be gained about human evolution, which is a critical aspect of history.

      <a class="anchor" id="analysis"></a>

      <h3>Analysis</h3>

      <p>
        The analysis is your argument, dissection, evaluation, interpretation, etc. of what
        happened. When you analyze, you are:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>making connections</li>
        <li>reading between the lines</li>
        <li>making inferences</li>
        <li>drawing conclusions</li>
        <li>
          Within your essay, your summary will provide necessary context for the analysis. Your
          analysis will support your thesis.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Examples:</p>

      <div class="block">
        <p>In the examples below, the analysis is bolded.</p>
        <p>
          Jefferson believed in limited government and a strict interpretation of the Constitution.

            >Therefore, he would be disappointed in the direction the country has taken in the
            centuries since his presidency.</strong
          >
        </p>

        <p>
          Although the Roman Empire was thought to be invincible, political and economic failures
          ultimately led to its demise.
          <strong
            >If a modern-day powerhouse like the United States does not closely examine its own
            potential pitfalls, a similar fate could come to fruition.</strong

      <div class="sectionBreak"></div>

      <a class="anchor" id="transitionWords"></a>

      <h3>Transition Words</h3>

      <p>
        Use transitions of conclusion and consequence or sentence starters when connecting your
        background information to your analysis.
      </p>

      <p>Transition/sentence starters for analysis:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Thus</li>
        <li>Therefore</li>
        <li>As a result</li>
        <li>This being the case</li>
        <li>This shows</li>
        <li>This proves</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Examples:</p>

      <div class="block">
        <p>
          The Cleveland Cavaliers, dealing with injuries to superstars Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love,
          were forced to rely on inconsistent players such as JR Smith and Iman Shumpert.
          <strong>Consequently</strong>, Lebron James was forced to take more shots and play more
          minutes.

      <h3>Intregrating Quotes</h3>

      <p>Integrate quotes into your essay to support your argument.</p>

      <p>Examples:</p>

      <div class="block">
        <p>
          The Vikings were barbaric savages that disregarded religion. According to the
          <em>Annals of St. Vaast</em>, “they...razed monasteries and churches to the ground, and
          brought to their death the servants of our holy religion” (http://www.deremilitari.org).
        </p>

        <p>
          The Vikings were one of the most resourceful, intelligent societies of their time. Viking
          ship design was unparalleled; “fast, light, maneuverable, and flexible, it could be simply
          beached and quickly launched, rowed by oarsmen or sailed in any wind” (Sorabella
          http://www.metmuseum.org).
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="sectionBreak"></div>

      <a class="anchor" id="inTextCitations"></a>

      <h3>Creating In-Text Citations</h3>

      <p>
        When completing academic work, it is important to cite other authors and publishers to give
        them due credit. The in-text citations must align with the Works Cited page added to the end
        of your paper.
      </p>

      <p>
        When quoting or paraphrasing an author, the author’s last name must be provided within the
        sentence itself or the parenthetical citation. The page number(s) must always be placed
        inside parenthetical citations.
      </p>

      <p>Examples:</p>

      <div class="block">
        <p>
          The president relied heavily on the advice of Hamilton, with some seeing him as “tricking
          the dunderheaded Washington into supporting him” (Chernow 544).
        </p>
        <p>
          As Chernow notes, the president relied heavily on the advice of Hamilton, with some seeing
          him as “tricking the dunderheaded Washington into supporting him” (544).
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>
        When citing online sources, follow these steps from
        <a href="https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/747/02/">Purdue OWL</a>:
      </p>

      <div class="block quote">
        <ul>
          <li>
            Include in the text the first item that appears in the Work Cited entry that corresponds
            to the citation (e.g. author name, article name, website name, film name).
          </li>
          <li>
            You do not need to give paragraph numbers or page numbers based on your Web browser’s
            print preview function.
          </li>
          <li>
            Unless you must list the Website name in the signal phrase in order to get the reader to
            the appropriate entry, do not include URLs in-text. Only provide partial URLs such as
            when the name of the site includes, for example, a domain name, like CNN.com or
            Forbes.com as opposed to writing out http://www.cnn.com or http://www.forbes.com.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="sectionBreak"></div>

      <a class="anchor" id="conclusions"></a>

      <h3>Conclusions</h3>

      <p>
        This is where you sum up your findings. You do not repeat exact phrases from your thesis,
        but you should find alternate words to explain why your claim is correct.
      </p>

      <p>
        In an essay of 3 or more paragraphs, it is a complete paragraph. It should involve synthesis
        to previous knowledge or whole world significance.
      </p>

      <p>Example:</p>

      <div class="block">
        <p>Essay prompt: Why was slavery so difficult to abolish?</p>

        <p>
          Conclusion paragraph:
          <em
            >Ultimately, the eradication of slavery was a challenging goal to attain because of
            racism in the South, the creation of the cotton gin, and the lack of education for
            slaves. Before the civil war, the atmosphere in the South was tense at best. Most people
            in the United States had conflicting views on what to do about slavery, and it took
            quite some time to reach a favorable consensus. However, eventually the abolition of
            slavery became a reality: black people were now considered free.</em

      <div class="sectionBreak"></div>

      <a class="anchor" id="otherWritingTips"></a>

      <h3>Other Writing Tips</h3>

      <p>Avoid using the word 'thing.' Find a better, more specific word.</p>

      <p>Be careful with the use of qualifiers/intensifiers. Find a stronger word instead.</p>

      <p>Be careful when making absolute statements. Example:</p>

      <div class="block">
        <ul>
          <li>X always/never does Y.</li>
          <li>All Yankee fans love Derek Jeter.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It only takes one instance for the statement to be incorrect.</p>
      </div>

      <p>
        When mentioning someone for the first time, provide their title/occupation or other
        identifying information to provide context for the reader. For example:
      </p>

      <div class="block">
        <p>New Jersey Senator Theodore Frelinghuysen</p>
      </div>

      <p>
        It is okay to be critical of historical figures/events. Not everything has to end with
        sunshine and rainbows. An example to avoid:
      </p>

      <div class="block">
        <p>
          And then the colonists and American Indians lived together in harmony, happily ever after.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>
        Make sure the vocabulary of your essay matches the formal tone. For example, use
        "possessions" instead of "stuff."
      </p>

      <h3>Sample A-level Essay</h3>

      <p>
        <em
          >This is an A-level essay. This introduction clearly explains the Electoral College and
          transitions into a thesis statement. The thesis statement is clear, specific, and
          insightful. Each of the body paragraphs contains an argument that supports the thesis.
          Analysis is supported with relevant and accurate evidence. The conclusion summarizes the
          argument made within the essay, without being too repetitive. Some new insight is included
          to support the thesis.</em
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        There have been over 55 presidential elections in the United States, and they have all
        determined the President through a system known as the Electoral College. This system gives
        every state a certain number of electoral votes: two from the Senate plus however many
        representatives that state has in the House of Representatives; Washington D.C. receives
        three electoral votes. If a candidate wins the popular vote in a state, all of the state’s
        electoral votes go to that candidate. If a candidate gets more than half of the 538 total
        votes in the country, then he or she is elected as the U.S. President. However, the
        Electoral College has produced faulty results throughout history, and can be taken advantage
        of by candidates to win an election, even without the popular vote. As shown by the
        excessive power of voters in smaller states and the unfair freedom permitting some electors
        to vote against a candidate that has been voted for by the majority of their state, the
        Electoral College is a flawed and faulty system and needs to be abolished.<br /><br />
        In this system, voters in smaller states get more power than is fair. As explained above,
        each state gets a certain number of electoral votes in the Electoral College—two plus the
        number of legislators representing that state in the House of Representatives. When voting
        for something as important as the next leader of a country, every vote should be considered
        equally by determining the number of electoral votes a state receives solely by population;
        however, with the Electoral College, this does not happen. Because each state gets two
        additional votes from the Senate, some states such as Wyoming and Rhode Island get three or
        four electoral votes when they should really only be getting one or two. Larger states such
        as Texas and California give up as many as ten votes to these smaller states. The Electoral
        College distorts the number of votes each state should receive to the point where a vote of
        a Wyoming citizen is worth four times that of a Californian’s vote. As a result of using
        this system, a candidate could win an election with only 22% of the popular vote by winning
        small states by small margins. In other words, massive inequality between voters of
        different states ensue from this system. As wrong as this may seem, this is not the only
        faulty aspect of the Electoral College.<br /><br />
        One of the most unjust parts of the Electoral College is that in some states, electors can
        vote against their own states. In other words, on Election Day, people do not directly vote
        for candidates; they vote for electors, who then vote for candidates. For example, if
        everyone in a state votes for a Democratic or Republican candidate, then an elector or a
        group of electors appointed by the winning party attends the collegiate meeting that
        determines the next president of the United States. However, in as many as 21 states, an
        amount that can easily tip the scales, an elector, or group of electors, are not required to
        vote for whichever candidate their state voted for. electors have voted against their own
        states 87 times in the past. This system is inequitable; it allows the decision of the
        leader of a country to be decided amongst only a few people.<br /><br />
        The Electoral College is an unjust system of choosing the President of the United States as
        demonstrated by the immoderate amounts of power given to voters in less populated states and
        the unfair freedom given to some electors to vote against their own states. This system
        creates a substantial amount of inequality between voters of different states, and
        consequently, by gaming the system, a candidate can be elected without the popular vote.
        This has happened five times in the past, and can happen again. Given how important electing
        the U.S. President is, a faulty system such as the Electoral College may lead to disastrous
        consequences.

        <em
          >This B-level essay has an introduction that provides some context for the reader and a
          thesis statement that outlines the argument being made. The introduction hastily moves
          from background information to the argument and a smoother transition should be included.
          The body paragraphs cite evidence to support an argument, but the argument is inconsistent
          and even contradictory at times (e.g. claims that the Electoral College favors smaller
          states followed up with additional claims that the it is unfair to smaller states). In
          addition, quotes should be integrated into the essay.</em

      <p>
        The Electoral College in the United States government, is the body of electors that choose
        the President and Vice President. To win the election, a presidential candidate must have
        the majority of votes in the electoral college. The country receives 538 electoral votes,
        that are divided across the country. The country also should have a system where the
        election can no way end in a tie. Therefore, there are some parts to this process that are
        unfair towards electing a president. The Electoral College should be abolished so the votes
        are worth the same, and so the election does not end in a tie.<br /><br />
        One reason why the electoral vote should be abolished, is so that the votes are equal. The
        electoral college gives non-equal voting power to states, thus favoring the smaller states
        with a larger amount of electoral votes. The country has 538 electoral votes, and should be
        distributed evenly throughout each state. States with a larger population have a larger
        number of electoral votes making it unfair for states with a lower population such as
        Wyoming and the Dakotas. “There are 11,500,000 people in Ohio so, to fairly represent them,
        it should get 20 electoral votes. But the Electoral college doesn’t give Ohio 20 votes, it
        only gets 18 – two less than it should.” (<em
          >The Trouble with the Electoral College." YouTube. CGP Grey, 07 Nov. 2011. Web. 13 Oct.
          2016</em
        >). Therefore, abolishing the Electoral College will make it more fair and even towards each
        state's votes.<br /><br />
        Another reason why the electoral vote should be abolished is so the votes do not end in a
        tie. Currently, the country has 538 electoral votes. This number is even, which means that
        the election could result in 269-269 tie. If this occurs, the vote goes to the House of
        Representatives. People consider this unfair because it is not their vote that is being
        counted. “The rules of the Electoral College system for dealing with a tie are bizarre and
        scary and create a fairly plausible scenario by which no one would be elected president in
        time for Inauguration Day.” (<em
          >10/16/12, By Eric Black |, and By Eric Black | 10/15/12. "10 Reasons Why the Electoral
          College is a problem.” Minn post Web 13. Oct 2016</em
        >). This shows that the electoral college is not a good idea because our election may end in
        a tie.<br /><br />
        In conclusion, the United States should move towards a more direct approach in the election
        process by eliminating the possibility of a tie, and ensuring that each state’s voting power
        is equal. The Electoral College has been used since 1787, but this practice needs to come to
        an end. Smaller states are overpowered making bigger and less populated states less
        important and likewise less valuable when it comes to voting who the next President and Vice
        President will be. The election ending in a tie is also flawed, since it would not be the
        people who decide in the end; the vote would be then given to the House of Representatives!
        After all, in the famous words of Abraham Lincoln, “this is a government OF the people, BY
        the people, and FOR the people.” The popular vote should be instituted; and the Electoral
        College should be abolished.
